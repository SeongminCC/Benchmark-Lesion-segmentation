# Benchmark on Lesion Segmentations including SOTAR(2022-10)   

When people who try to do lesion segmentation using deep learning model, It is difficult to decide deep learning model considering their type of medical images or their environment. And all the people in this situation have different needs respectively. *ex) efficiency, performance, low capacity, time, etc...*   

So, we compared 9 deep learning models on 6 medical datasets for lesion segmentations in this research.
